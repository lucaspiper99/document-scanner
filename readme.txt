The file getCorners.py has been modified, and the sent version has to be used.

The code can be executed by running the command pivproject2021(task,  reference_path ,path_to_output_folder , path_to_input_folder, arg2)
where: 
	the task has to be 1, 
	the reference_path has to be the path to the template, 
	the path_to_output_folder has to be the path to the output folder,
	the path_to_input_folder has to be the path to the input folder,
	the arg2 is indifferent.

As for example:

	pivproject2021(1,  "DATASETS\InitialDataset\templates\template2_fewArucos.png" ,"output" ,"input", 0)

It was only used the default matlab toolbox and the opencv library for python.
